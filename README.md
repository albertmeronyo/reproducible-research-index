Awesomeness

- Structured queries among reproducible experiments - what’s used linux, what’s used pandas, etc.
- IDEA2: lab specifications (hardware specs, are those part of docker too?), have those specified in RDF too, integrate with experiment docker specs,

For experiment specs:
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

For labs specs ([IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)):
- [Chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(software))
- [Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software))
- [Terraform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software))


## Getting Dockerfiles
- The list of all official images in Docker Hub is easy, [here](https://hub.docker.com/explore/?page=1)
- Similarly, the ones at the docker store, [here](https://store.docker.com/search?source=verified&type=image)
- For the non official, we can get some using `docker search foo`
- [This script](https://github.com/ivanilves/lstags) on comparing registries might be useful
